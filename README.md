# UAG-Demo

This is a prototype of an anime style modern shipgirl battle card game rpg, featuring the dialogue(powered by dialogic), the turn-based battle function and a simple user interface. This game is still under development.

A link to the actual demo is here -> https://dempor.itch.io/uag-demo (Github does not allow a file bigger than 25mb to be uploaded so sorry =[ )

This is NOT a virus, I haven't got that far in my coding skills yet.

This prototype is under MIT licence
